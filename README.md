# LCD Timer Example

This Arduino-based project displays a timer on a 16x2 LCD, updating every second, along with whether the current second count is even or odd.

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- 16x2 LCD display
- LiquidCrystal library (included in the Arduino IDE)

## Circuit

Connect the LCD pins as follows:

- RS to Pin 12
- Enable to Pin 11
- D4 to Pin 5
- D5 to Pin 4
- D6 to Pin 3
- D7 to Pin 2

## Output

Secs: 1 is Odd
Secs: 2 is Even
Secs: 3 is Odd
Secs: 4 is Even
Secs: 5 is Odd
Secs: 6 is Even
